# Bus_Route_Recommender

## Bus Route Recommendation System (KNN-Based)

A simple machine learning project that recommends bus routes based on user preferences using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic recommendation system built with:

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (KNN Algorithm)

The system suggests the most similar bus route based on:

- Distance (km)
- Travel Time (minutes)
- Popularity score

It uses **Euclidean distance** to find the closest matching routes.

---

## Important Note

- This project does not use real-world or live transportation data.
- The dataset is manually created and predefined within the code.
- It is developed purely for learning and demonstration purposes.

---

## How It Works

- A dataset of bus routes is created (predefined inside the script).
- Features used:
  - Distance
  - Travel Time
  - Popularity
- The KNN model is trained using `NearestNeighbors`.
- The user enters preferred route characteristics.
- The model recommends the closest matching route.
